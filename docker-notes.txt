I ran into a similar issue, believe this occurs when your VM is inactive.
Here's how I remedied the situation

docker-machine rm default
after it's cleaned up you can create a new default machine (assuming you haven't heavily modified it,
 then you'll probably want to script/automate that with packer/terraform etc)

docker-machine create default --driver virtualbox
